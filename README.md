# nlp-weather
A really, really basic NLP-Processor for extracting a request for a forecast from people-speak in a not-so-brittle manner with a really, really lightweight [Concierge](https://github.com/concierge/) module ([Concierge](https://github.com/concierge/) is cool so you can *sometimes* get your forecast in your chat.

Notes:
- This is really, really, untested (here be dragons)
- This will almost certainly break with timezones (timezones are the worst)


# Instructions (which might even work, if you're lucky)
1. Clone the repository

        git clone https://github.com/fallaciousreasoning/nlp-weather.git

2. Install npm packages

        npm install

3. Cross, fingers, hope that I actually saved all the packages

4. Cry; install packages that weren't saved

5. Run the program

        npm start

    or

        node main.js
