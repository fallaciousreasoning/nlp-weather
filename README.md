# nlp-weather
A really, really basic NLP-Processor for extracting a request for a forecast from people-speak in a not-so-brittle manner with a really, really lightweight [Concierge](https://github.com/concierge/) module ([Concierge](https://github.com/concierge/) is cool so you can *sometimes* get your forecast in your chat.

Notes:
- This is really, really, untested (here be dragons)
- This will almost certainly break with timezones (timezones are the worst)
